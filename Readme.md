## Summary
A simple project to learn more about rendering for games. Maybe it will evolve to something more one day.

## Origin
This project is currently a product of the tutorial series available at [learnopengl.com](https://www.learnopengl.com)
The tutorial series covers a lot of topics from basic rendering to deferred rendering.

I plan to heavily modify the code to create a more flexible engine later, but you gotta learn to crawl before you can walk.
